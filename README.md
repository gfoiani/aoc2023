# Advent of Code 2020

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

You can find the Advent of Code 2023 [here](https://adventofcode.com/2023/).

In this repo I'll be posting my solutions written in NodeJS.

## Run a puzzle

```NodeJS
